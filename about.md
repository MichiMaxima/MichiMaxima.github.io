### What happened so far
Until now nothing special happended. I just finished my school education and since 2020 I am studying studying Computer Science at [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/), Germany. Right now I am doing a 5 month study abroad at [Hokkaido University](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/), Japan. In order to be able to afford my studies, I am sponsored by the German National Academic Foundation ("Studienstiftung des deutschen Voleks"), among others.
